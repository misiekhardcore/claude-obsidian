# daily-append.sh — AC1 deterministic regression for issue #98.
#
# Drives `obsidian create-or-append` directly, three times back-to-back against
# a scratch file under the active vault, and asserts that all three bullets
# survive — the exact failure mode #98 reported (one bullet silently dropped
# under read-modify-overwrite at the model layer). Because the verbs are pure
# wrapper synthesis with no LLM in the loop, this test is deterministic and
# completes in well under a second when Obsidian is running.
#
# Scope vs cli-smoke: this test is targeted at the bug, not the verb contract.
# Verb-level coverage (file-exists append, file-missing create+append,
# frontmatter-set replace/insert/malformed) lives in tests/cli-smoke.sh.
#
# Scope vs E2E: the full E2E harness (make e2e) drives /daily through claude -p
# and validates the model + skill + hook + CLI stack end-to-end. This script
# only verifies the CLI verb itself does not lose bullets — that is sufficient
# for AC1 because the new daily skill flow has no read-modify-write path the
# model can corrupt.
#
# Usage:
#   bash tests/regression/daily-append.sh
#
# Exits 0 on pass, 1 on assertion failure, 0 with a skip notice if Obsidian
# is unreachable (matches the cli-smoke skip pattern).
