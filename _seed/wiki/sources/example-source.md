# Example Source

## Summary

A source page is the ingest record for a single document. It holds the document's metadata, a summary, and the key claims extracted from it. Downstream concept and entity pages link back here as their evidence.

## Key Claims

- Source pages use `confidence: EXTRACTED` because they summarize what is directly in the document
- The `key_claims` frontmatter field holds the most important findings as a flat list
- `source_reliability` captures how trustworthy the source itself is (high / medium / low)

## Entities Mentioned

- [[example-entity]] — illustrates how entities are linked from source pages

## Concepts Introduced

- [[example-concept]] — illustrates how concepts are linked from source pages

## Notes

Replace this page with a real source by running `/wiki ingest` on a document.
