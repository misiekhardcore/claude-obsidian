# vault-search

Quick vault lookups using obsidian CLI. For full synthesis with filing-back, use the `query` skill.

## Vault I/O

[Instructions on how to interact with the vault](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/vault-ops.md).

All vault reads use `scripts/obsidian-cli.sh` — never grep, never direct file tools.

## Workflow

1. **Read `wiki/hot.md` first.** If it answers the question, respond immediately with `[[hot]]` citations. No further lookup needed.

2. **Search with obsidian CLI.** For each key term, run:
   ```bash
   obsidian search query=<term>
   ```
   Never use grep. The CLI handles indexing, wikilinks, and frontmatter.

3. **Read candidates cheapest-first.** Escalate only when cheaper reads don't suffice:
   - `obsidian outline path=<page>` — structure check (~5-15 lines)
   - `obsidian read-head path=<page> lines=30` — frontmatter + intro
   - `obsidian grep path=<page> pattern=<term>` — find specific content
   - `obsidian read path=<page>` — full read (most expensive, last resort)

4. **Backlink-check key pages.** For pages that appear central:
   ```bash
   obsidian backlinks path=<page> format=json
   ```
   This surfaces hub membership, canonical references, and trail pages.

5. **Respond with citations.** Always cite sources as `[[wikilink]]`.

6. **If the vault lacks the answer**, say so clearly and offer to run `/query` for deep synthesis.

## Token Discipline

|Read|Cost|Stop if|
|-|-|-|
|`wiki/hot.md`|~500 tokens|Answer found|
|`obsidian search`|~100 tokens|Relevant page found|
|`obsidian outline` / `read-head`|~300 tokens each|Sufficient detail|
|`obsidian read` (full)|~500-2000 tokens|Only when cheaper reads insufficient|
