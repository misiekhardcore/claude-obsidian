# autoresearch

Run iterative web searches on a topic, synthesize findings, and file everything into wiki pages. Based on Karpathy's autoresearch pattern.

## Before Starting

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/research-program.md` for research objectives, confidence scoring rules, loop constraints, and domain-specific preferences.

## Vault I/O

All vault writes go through the `obsidian` CLI. See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/cli.md` for syntax and escaping.

## Agent dispatch overview

|Phase|Who runs it|Agent|
|-|-|-|
|Round 1 (broad search + fetch)|**Main thread inline**|—|
|Round 1 source filing|**Parallel fan-out**|`agents/source-synth.md` (one per fetched source)|
|Round 2 gap-fill branches|**Parallel fan-out**|`agents/research-round.md` (one per gap)|
|Round 3 synthesis check|**Single dispatch**|`agents/research-round.md`|
|Synthesis page + trail|**Main thread inline**|—|
|Index / log / hot.md|**Main thread inline**|—|

Before spawning any agents, verify CWD:

```bash
cd "${VAULT_ROOT}" && pwd   # confirm vault root before agent fan-out
```

## Research Loop

```text
Input: topic (from user command)

Round 1. Broad search — INLINE (main thread)
1. Decompose topic into 3-5 distinct search angles
2. For each angle: run 2-3 WebSearch queries
3. For top 2-3 results per angle: WebFetch the page
4. Extract from each: key claims, entities, concepts, open questions
5. Dispatch one agents/source-synth.md per fetched source IN PARALLEL.
   Pass: SOURCE_CONTENT, SOURCE_URL, RAW_PATH, VAULT_ROOT, TODAY, RESEARCH_TOPIC.
   Wait for all source-synth agents to finish. Collect their reports.

Round 2. Gap fill — PARALLEL AGENT FAN-OUT
5. Identify what's missing or contradicted from Round 1
6. For each gap, dispatch one agents/research-round.md IN PARALLEL.
   Pass: GAP, RESEARCH_TOPIC, EXISTING_SOURCES (URLs fetched in Round 1),
         MAX_QUERIES=5, MAX_FETCHES=3, VAULT_ROOT, TODAY.
   Wait for all research-round agents to finish. Collect their reports.

Round 3. Synthesis check — SINGLE AGENT DISPATCH (optional, if gaps remain)
7. If major contradictions or missing pieces still exist: dispatch one
   agents/research-round.md for the remaining gap.
8. Otherwise: proceed to filing

Max rounds: 3 (as set in program.md). Stop when depth is reached or max rounds hit.
```

## Filing Results

After research is complete, create these pages:

**wiki/sources/**. One page per major reference found

- Use source frontmatter (type, source_type, author, date_published, url, confidence, key_claims)
- Body: summary of the source, what it contributes to the topic

**wiki/concepts/**. One page per significant concept extracted

- Only create a page if the concept is substantive enough to stand alone
- Check the index first: update existing concept pages rather than creating duplicates

**wiki/entities/**. One page per significant person, org, or product identified

- Check the index first: update existing entity pages

**wiki/questions/**. One synthesis page titled "Research: [Topic]"

- This is the master synthesis. Everything comes together here.
- Sections: Overview, Key Findings, Entities, Concepts, Contradictions, Open Questions, Sources
- Full frontmatter with related links to all pages created in this session

**wiki/trails/**. Exactly one `type: trail` page per run, regardless of atomic-note count

- Filename: `wiki/trails/Trail: [Topic] (YYYY-MM-DD).md` (the date suffix uses the run date, so multiple runs on the same topic produce distinct files — never merge or overwrite).
- Emit immediately **after** the synthesis page is written and **before** any `## After Filing` step (index, log, hot.md). The index and log entries naturally pick the trail up from this position.
- Body is an ordered Markdown list. One step per atomic note created in this run, in argument order. Each step has exactly one `[[wikilink]]` to that atomic note plus a single LLM-synthesized one-line annotation describing the note's role in the argument (why this note next, what it contributes).
- No minimum atomic-note count. A run that produced one note still emits a one-step trail — the run-record value beats the empty-trail cost.
- Create `wiki/trails/` lazily on first emission if it does not exist.

## Page Schemas

See `references/page-schemas.md` for full synthesis and trail templates. Key rules:
- **Synthesis pages**: one `type: synthesis`, `related:` lists all created pages, sections include Overview, Key Findings, Entities, Concepts, Contradictions, Open Questions, Sources.
- **Trail pages**: one `type: trail`, `status: mature`, `confidence: EXTRACTED`, body is **exactly one** ordered list with one wikilink + annotation per item (no URLs, no extra wikilinks in annotations).

## After Filing

1. Update `wiki/index.md`. Add all new pages to the right sections
2. Append to `wiki/log.md` (at the TOP):
   ```text
   ## [YYYY-MM-DD] autoresearch | [Topic]
   - Rounds: N
   - Sources found: N
   - Pages created: [[Page 1]], [[Page 2]], ...
   - Synthesis: [[Research: Topic]]
   - Trail: [[Trail: Topic (YYYY-MM-DD)]]
   - Key finding: [one sentence]
   ```
3. Update `wiki/hot.md` with the research summary. For the full hot-cache protocol (when to read, when to update, sub-agent discipline), see `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/hot-cache-protocol.md`.

## Report to User

```text
Research complete: [Topic]
Rounds: N | Searches: N | Pages created: N
Created:
  wiki/questions/Research: [Topic].md
  wiki/trails/Trail: [Topic] (YYYY-MM-DD).md
  wiki/sources/[Source 1].md
  wiki/concepts/[Concept 1].md
  wiki/entities/[Entity 1].md
Key findings: [3 bullets]
Open questions filed: N
```

## Constraints

Follow limits in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/research-program.md` (max rounds, max pages, confidence scoring, source preference). Respect constraints over completeness; note gaps in Open Questions section.
