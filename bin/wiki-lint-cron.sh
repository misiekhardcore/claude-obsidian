#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Standalone wiki-lint runner intended for system cron.
#
# One-shot: invokes the lint skill via the `claude` CLI and stamps the lastrun
# marker on success. Exits non-zero on resolve-vault failure or when Obsidian
# is unreachable (so cron surfaces the error in mail/logs); lint-skill output
# flows through to stdout/stderr.
#
# Runs unattended: pre-authorizes the lint skill to auto-fix every category
# it classifies as 'safe to auto-fix' (missing frontmatter, stubs for missing
# entities, wikilinks for unlinked mentions). Categories that need human
# judgment (orphan deletion, contradiction resolution, duplicate merging)
# remain advisory and surface in the lint report only. Run `/lint` interactively
# to act on those.
#
# Requires Obsidian to be running — the CLI cannot reach a closed vault.
#
# Usage (example crontab — weekly, Sunday 03:00):
#   0 3 * * 0 /absolute/path/to/claude-obsidian/bin/wiki-lint-cron.sh
