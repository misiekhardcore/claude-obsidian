# Vault Structure

Cross-skill structural conventions for the claude-obsidian vault: directory layout, page types, confidence tagging semantics, and typed-relationship semantics.

Read this file when a skill needs to understand vault layout or interpret page metadata. Do not preload — read on demand.

## Directory Map

| Directory | Type value | What goes here | Naming convention |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| `wiki/concepts/` | `concept` | Patterns, techniques, ideas, how-things-work explanations | Title Case or kebab-case slug; no "the" prefix |
| `wiki/entities/` | `entity` | Named real-world things: people, tools, products, orgs, repos | Proper noun as named in the source |
| `wiki/sources/` | `source` | One page per ingested source — metadata, key findings, links to derived pages | `<slug>` matching the `.raw/` filename |
| `wiki/solutions/` | `solution` | Concrete recipes: how to accomplish a specific task end-to-end | Verb phrase, e.g. `configure-mcp-server` |
| `wiki/comparisons/` | `comparison` | Side-by-side analysis of 2+ alternatives | `<A>-vs-<B>` or `comparing-<topic>` |
| `wiki/questions/` | `question` | Open questions; closed questions link to the answer | Question as written, e.g. `why-tokens-compound` |
| `wiki/domains/` | `domain` | Top-level topic groupings; each domain has its own `_index.md` and may contain sub-directories | kebab-case domain name, e.g. `machine-learning` |
| `wiki/meta/` | `meta` | Index files, log, hot cache, overview — structural pages | Short functional names: `index`, `log`, `hot` |

**Examples:**
- `wiki/concepts/LLM Wiki Pattern.md` — a technique (concept)
- `wiki/entities/Andrej Karpathy.md` — a person (entity)
- `wiki/sources/llm-wiki-karpathy-gist.md` — the ingest record for a specific source
- `wiki/solutions/configure-mcp-server.md` — step-by-step recipe (solution)

## Confidence Tagging

Every page carries a `confidence:` field with one of three values:

| Value | Meaning | When to use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `EXTRACTED` | Claims sourced directly from a document | Source pages; entity/concept claims that are literally quoted |
| `INFERRED` | Claims derived by the LLM from sources | Most concept and entity pages |
| `AMBIGUOUS` | Conflicting signals; needs human review | Pages where sources contradict and resolution is unclear |

`AMBIGUOUS` pages must also list the open conflict in the `open_questions` field or in a `## Perspectives` section.

The `evidence:` field is a flat list of source wikilinks supporting the page's claims. Required for `INFERRED` and `AMBIGUOUS` pages.

**Default assignments by page type:**
- `source` pages → `EXTRACTED` (the page summarises what was directly found in the document)
- `concept` pages → `INFERRED` (LLM synthesis from one or more sources)
- `entity` pages → `INFERRED` (unless the entity's details are verbatim-quoted)
- `meta` pages (index, log, hot) → `EXTRACTED` (mechanically generated, not inferred)

## Typed Relationships

Alongside `related:`, use typed fields when the semantic is unambiguous:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `supersedes:` | This page replaces the listed page(s) |
| `contradicts:` | This page's claims conflict with the listed page(s) |
| `uses:` | This page/concept applies or depends on the listed page(s) |
| `depends_on:` | Stronger dependency — can't function without the listed page(s) |
| `caused:` | This page describes something that caused the listed outcome(s) |
| `fixed:` | This page describes a fix for the listed issue(s) |
| `implements:` | This page is an implementation of the listed spec/pattern(s) |

All typed relationship fields are optional flat lists. Keep `related:` for general or untyped links. Add typed fields only when the semantic is genuinely unambiguous.

For the YAML shape of these fields, see `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/_shared/frontmatter.md` §Typed Relationship Fields.
